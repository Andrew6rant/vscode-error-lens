Welcome to ErrorLens.

ErrorLens enhances Visual Studio Code's inbuilt diagnostic highlighting. Visual Studio Code's default behavior is to
underline errors and warnings and other diagnostic messages using a 'squiggly underline'. Whilst this is certainly
useful, the underline visual effect is subtle, and therefore can be easily overlooked in a busy file.

ErrorLens turbo-charges the language diagnostic features, by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting
the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the diagnostic message(s) in-line at
the site of the line of code which is generating the diagnostic.

## Features

* Lines containing errors or warnings or info are highlighted more obviously.
* Diagnostic descriptions are appended to the end of any line containing diagnostic info, meaning that you do not have to context-switch to the problem view.
* The status bar shows the number of diagnostics for the open file. (This can be configured)
* Settings can be configured to control the way ErrorLens displays enhanced diagnostics.
* Works for any language which provides diagnostics.
