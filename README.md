ErrorLens enhances Visual Studio Code's inbuilt diagnostic highlighting. Visual Studio Code's default behavior is to
underline errors and warnings and other diagnostic messages using a 'squiggly underline'. Whilst this is certainly
useful, the underline visual effect is subtle, and therefore can be easily overlooked in a busy file.

ErrorLens turbo-charges the language diagnostic features, by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting
the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the diagnostic message(s) in-line at
the site of the line of code which is generating the diagnostic.

## Extra

Example of using `source` & `code` or diagnostic message to exclude a problem:

```javascript
"errorLens.exclude": [
    // Use source and code
    {
        "code": "6133",// is declared but its value is never read.
        "source": "ts",
    },
    // Use diagnostic message
    "Unknown configuration setting"
],
```

Remove built-in problem decorations from `settings.json`:

```javascript
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorError.border": "#fff0",
    "editorError.foreground": "#fff0",
    "editorWarning.border": "#fff0",
    "editorWarning.foreground": "#fff0",
    // ...
}
```
